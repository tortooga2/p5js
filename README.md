#Particle-Sim

Inspired by space filler, written in p5.js. You can see it at: https://p5js-black.vercel.app/

It uses a spacial hashing method outlines in this Nvidia paper: https://developer.download.nvidia.com/assets/cuda/files/particles.pdf.
It is meant to for gpu/parallelization however it is also just a super simple algorithm in its own right. I like to think my implimentation is fairly nice however the current code is still very similair to my inisital implimenation.
